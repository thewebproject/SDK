The Web Project is a project which i wish to undertake with the help of some professional freelancers to create a slick Web Builder with hundreds of features which will help optimise the process of developing websites for web developers. The web builder will be accessed via our website or via any type of application such as the app that will be released on iOS and other platforms or the application that will be released on PC and mac. Some of the advanced features within this project include:

Easy Code Management! Code on the go!!
Custom plugins which allow a user to create their own plugins for their own panel needs which could be added to make life easier for developers.
Meta Tag and other SEO Optimization tactics
Backend graphing towards website views
Save Websites to our server from your device after you finish developing your website.
Full Control and Flexibility will allow the user to flexibly move around the different aspects of their websites such as tables and buttons. This will be easy on any device!
Device compatibility will provide the owner of any device access to their panel with easy app access. I am looking to add functionality to every popular operating systems such as iOS, Windows, Linux, Kindle, Macs, ChroniumOS, etc;.
Easy User Management within a panel
Configuration to allow the user customise the panel to their own needs.
Libraries will be able to be included to the panel in order for the developer to create other types of layouts.
